**Introduction: Python Script for London Population Analysis**

This Python script embarks on an illuminating course exercise, peeling back the layers of London's population changes. Navigating through a handful of probing questions, I delve into pivotal concepts like Timestamps, DateTimeIndexes, Timedeltas, Periods, and advanced hierarchical indexing (multi-index).

**Key Concepts Explored:**
- Time-indexed data
- Timestamp and DateTimeIndex
- TimeDelta and TimedeltaIndex
- Period and PeriodIndex
- Indicator variables and advanced hierarchical indexing (multi-index)
- Resampling

**Unlocking Insights:**
The essence of this analysis lies in the pursuit of revelation and examination. Visualizing changing variables unveils the patterns, trends, and stories woven into the dynamic datasets. The script demonstrates my adept handling of date and time strings, the construction of meaningful multi-indexes, and the precision in resampling time-series data.
